# Self-rated health

.pull-left[

### What is it?

Self-rated health refers to the question where participants rate different dimensions of their own health; it is commonly used in health research.

]

--

.pull-right[


### Example

#### On a scale from 1-5, how would you rate your physical (or mental) health?

**5. Excellent**

**4. Very good**

**3. Good**

**2. Fair**

**1. Poor**

# Conclusions

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Write Up]

We conducted two independent samples t-tests to determine if self-rated physical and mental health among U.S. adults differed in 2018 vs 2021. We found there to be a statistically significant difference for mental health (p < 0.001). However, we did not find there to be a statistically significant difference for physical health (p = 0.78).


]<!-- end of panel -->
.panel[.panel-name[Limitations]

* Possible violation of t-test assumption

* Survey methodology

]<!-- end of panel -->
.panel[.panel-name[Future implications]

Future research should investigate how mental health and physical health changed over time among subpopulations such as gender, race, ethnicity, and SES.

.panel[.panel-name[R programming]


#### What is it? 

R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics that you can use to clean, analyze, and graph your data. It is widely used by researchers from diverse disciplines to estimate and display results and by teachers of statistics and research methods. Most importantly, it's completely free!

#### Where can I learn more?

[Dr. Audrey Leroux](https://education.gsu.edu/profile/audrey-leroux/), assistant professor of research in the College of Education at GSU  teaches R programming in the course EPRS 8600 Computer Use in Education. If you are a GSU student and would like to learn how to analyze data in R, consider enrolling in the course!

[Dr. Andrew Heiss](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/andrew-heiss/) is an assistant professor in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University, as well as a certified [R/Rstudio instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/heiss+andrew/). He teaches R programming in his courses such as PMAP 8101 Data Visualization and PMAP 8521 Evaluation Research. Best of all, Dr. Heiss has made his [entire teaching catalog](https://www.andrewheiss.com/teaching/) available online for FREE, meaning you can access his content on R programming without having to enroll in his course!

.panel[.panel-name[Xaringan]

Xaringan (pronounced "Sharingan") is a package within R that allows you to make HTML presentations. If you have ever used Microsoft Powerpoint before, then Xaringan serves a similar purpose but with additional capabilities. If you'd like to learn more about Xaringan, below are some helpful resources:

- a [brief guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) on how to use Xaringan
- a [video workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3skTMQbCD0&t=2099s) on how to use Xaringan (part 1)
- a [video workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAtpZxW4bTI) on how to use Xaringan (part 2)
